# c4maxMap
After reading [this](http://jcarlosnorte.com/security/2016/03/06/hacking-tachographs-from-the-internets.html) article I decided that it may be fun to write a tool for generating maps of the locations of c4max TGUs.

When asking Censys for results you can press `ctrl+c` to intrupt the processes and proceed with the data you have so far.

To run this script you need both a [Shodan API key](https://developer.shodan.io/) and a [Google Maps Javascript API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) (to be put in the HTML file).
